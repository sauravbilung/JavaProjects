/*
* ðŸ”¹ Key Points:
* 1. Callable can return a result or throw exceptions.
* 2. Future.get() blocks until result is available.
*
* ExecutorService : An interface that represents an advanced, flexible thread pool mechanism to manage and control thread execution.
* Executors : A utility class (java.util.concurrent.Executors) that provides factory methods to create different types of ExecutorService instances easily.
*
* In simple words:
* ExecutorService : To manage and control asynchronous task execution.
* Executor : 	To create instances of thread pools or executor services easily.
