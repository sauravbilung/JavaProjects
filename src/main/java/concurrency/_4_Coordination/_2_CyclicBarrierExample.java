/**
 * A CyclicBarrier in Java is a synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to wait for each other to reach a common barrier point (i.e., a point in the code).
 * It's called cyclic because it can be reused after the waiting threads are released.
 *
 * ðŸ”§ Key Concepts:
 * Part of java.util.concurrent package.
 * All threads wait at the barrier until a specified number of threads (parties) have called await().
 * Once the last thread arrives, all waiting threads are released simultaneously.
 * Can optionally execute a barrier action (a Runnable) once the last thread arrives.
