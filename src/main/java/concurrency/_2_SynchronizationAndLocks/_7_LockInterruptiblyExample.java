/*
* If we use lock() instead of lockInterruptibly(), then a thread trying to acquire the lock will be blocked indefinitely ‚Äî even if it's interrupted.
*
* üîí lock() behavior:
It ignores Thread.interrupt() while waiting.
//The thread stays in the "waiting for lock" state. Blocked state.
No InterruptedException is thrown.
Only once the lock becomes available will the thread proceed.
*
* ‚úÖ lockInterruptibly() is different:
If the thread is interrupted while waiting for lock, it:
Immediately stops waiting
Throws InterruptedException
We can handle it (e.g., log, exit thread, etc.)

|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **BLOCKED**         | Waiting to acquire a **monitor/lock**       | Another **thread's lock**               | ‚ùå Only `lockInterruptibly()` is interruptible | `synchronized`, `lock()`                |
| **WAITING**         | Waiting for a **signal or notification**    | **Another thread's action**, not a lock | ‚úÖ Yes                                         | `Object.wait()`, `Thread.join()`, `LockSupport.park()` |

* üîí Lock-related operations put a thread in the BLOCKED state if the lock is unavailable.

|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `synchronized (obj)`             | If another thread holds the monitor on `obj`  |
| `ReentrantLock.lock()`           | If another thread holds the lock              |
| `ReentrantLock.lockInterruptibly()` | Same as above (but can respond to interrupt) |
| `ReentrantLock.tryLock()`        | ‚ùå Never blocks (returns immediately)         |
