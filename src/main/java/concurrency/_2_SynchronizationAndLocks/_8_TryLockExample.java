üí° Conclusion:
lock() is efficient and does not cause busy waiting. By using lock(). if lock is not available, OS puts thread to sleep(blocked state) until it's notified.
tryLock() is useful when you want to avoid blocking and possibly do something else if the lock isn't immediately available.

üîç If tryLock() often skips the critical section‚Ä¶ then why use it at all?
Because in many real-world scenarios, we don't want to block or wait if a resource is busy. We want to make a fast decision and move on.

‚úÖ Real-World Scenarios Where tryLock() Is Exactly What You Need:
1. Deadlock Avoidance in Multi-Lock Scenarios
2. Responsive Systems (e.g., UI, Real-Time, Microservices) :
    -- In UI apps or event-driven systems: you don‚Äôt want to freeze the interface.
    -- If a resource is busy, do something else and check again later.
3. Timeouts with tryLock(time, unit) : wait for short time but not indefinitely.
