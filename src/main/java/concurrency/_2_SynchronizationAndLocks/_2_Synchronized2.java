/*
* ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts
* In Java, when a method is marked synchronized, the thread needs to acquire the intrinsic lock (monitor) of the object before it can execute that method.
* Both methodA() and methodB() are synchronized instance methods, so they lock on the same object, i.e., the test object of class SyncTest.
*
* Note : Whether Thread-1 or Thread-2 gets the lock after it's released is non-deterministic â€” depends on OS scheduler.
* But while one thread holds it, others just wait in Blocked state.
